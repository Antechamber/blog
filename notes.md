create:
    signup page (skip?)
    <!-- compose page -->
    <!-- login page -->
    <!-- article rendering
    projects -->
    list of articles for logged in user with article edit links
        -auth for the edit links has to include a unique script to make sure the editor was the original author or else an admin (aka me)

test:
    <!-- composition -->
    <!-- user auth -->
